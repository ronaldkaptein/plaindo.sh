A list of things I may want to implement in the future, also for my own reference:

- Allow for adding tags/contexts, e.g. @today
- Allow to recur tasks with due date
- Allow for replacing a todo
- Allow to mark as done and re-enter
- Allow for minimal terminal coloring/highlighting, e.g. only bold tasks
